# dataStructuresWithJS
Solving common data structure questions using Javascript

So you have just graduated out of grad school? An engineering college? Great! You attend interviews and you come across
questions which seem almost trivially easy at first but seem very tough to solve. 
You might be a hot shot developer who has developed a cool front end using the latest JS framework, but in an interview 
with your next hot shot company, solving anagrams seemed like an impossible task? 
You are a bad ass backend dev but sometimes some architectures use simple data structures which seem innately easy but 
feels very hard to implement?

If you belong to any of the above category, then this repo aims to address those concerns. This repo in short will give a 
brief yet almost simple to follow code snippets/files to address some basic concepts. If you have a better solution to any of
the solutions, feel free to raise a PR! 

This repo will be updated slowly but contiously starting with basics and hopefully move on to more complicated ones. 
While I understand JS seems like a questionable choice for implementing data structures and for all the bad rep it gets, it
still allows you to focus on logic, is easy to pick up and widely used than any other language out there. In future I hope to
update this with Python and Golang versions.
For now JS will do the job to get the ball rolling.
